UML Id: 2
User Story: Hello, i'm jame and i think an idea like gantt needs to be able to 
save the current state of a project so it can be shared, for example, in my own 
company between my collegues so we all can have acess to the project's planning. 
Also think i would need to be able to try new implementations of the project without 
having to worry about the stable version of the project being lost within this trys.
