1: Good example with a very good explanation, very clear and direct.

2: It's a good code smell and well explained but i think there are more suitable classes 
for that, in this case there is only 4 parameters, the thing is that 
they have big names so it seems like more. Overall good explanation  
aswell but i think there are better examples.

3: I completly agree with this code smell, also well explained.
