1. - Very good two different examples. The first one is smaller than the second, but still it can be refactored in a
smaller method with auxiliar functions. The second one is clearly a long method (with 126 lines) and, for sure, it can
be simplified.

2. - Good and succint identification and possible solution of 3 different types of code smell found in one class.

3. - This code smell is pretty obvious as the coordinates should be encapsuled.
