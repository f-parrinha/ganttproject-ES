1. - Very good two different examples. The first one is smaller than the second, but still it can be refactored in a
smaller method with auxiliar functions. The second one is clearly a long method (with 126 lines) and, for sure, it can
be simplified.

2. - Good and succint identification and possible solution of 3 different types of code smell found in one class.

3. - This code smell is pretty obvious as the coordinates should be encapsuled.

1: Good example with a very good explanation, very clear and direct.

2: It's a good code smell and well explained but i think there are more suitable classes
for that, in this case there is only 4 parameters, the thing is that
they have big names so it seems like more. Overall good explanation
aswell but i think there are better examples.

3: I completly agree with this code smell, also well explained.

The code smells are well identified as well as well specified, explains where they are and speculates wisely on the topic.

Review:
I agree with all the code smells. For each anti-pattern there is a screenshot, an exact location on the codebase and small rationale.
The look of the document is good as well.
Change “Aluno” to “Student” since the doc is written in english.
